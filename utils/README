Development related utils.

genspritelist.sh: Generates header files listing the different sprite
		  types from the sources in src/sprite_types.

showanim.c: Utility to preview animations over different backgrounds
            and at different speeds.

hfsmooth.c: Loads an image and interprets the red component
	    as the high byte of a 16 bit integer, and the green
	    component as the low byte. It then smooths the
	    resulting field, and saves the result in a new 
	    image. This is usable when creating heightfields
	    for use in povray.

blur.sh: Given a list of images this script will average them
	 two and two, place the result in the first filename in 
	 each pair, and remove the second one. The result is
	 a simple form of motion blur.
	 example: 
            
            blur.sh 1.png 2.png 3.png 4.png
         
         Will replace 1.png with the average of
	 1.png and 2.png, and 3.png with the average of 
         3.png and 4.png. 2.png and 4.png will be deleted.
	
        The script can of course be applied several times for
	better quality blur.
