Requirements:
	A C compiler.
		The game is developed using gcc (2.95 and 3.2), but
		with small modifications it should be portable
		to other compilers. You may have to define INLINE
		suitably in the makefile.
		The makefile uses the -MM option of gcc, but
		this is not neccessary for a simple build.
	
	GNU make
		The makefile also uses sed, grep and sh.
		You can probably live without this, but why bother?

	SDL 	
		Any version >= 1.2 will probably work. Run 
		'sdl-config --version' to see if you have this.
		If not, go to www.libsdl.org and get the development
		package. (Just having the runtime library is not
		enough.)
	
	SDL_image 
		Library for loading png files. This should
		be availible from the same place as SDL. 

Building:
	Run make in the top level directory. This should
	create an executable named 'airstrike', which
	must be run from the top level directory for it
	to find the data files. This will change in the future.

If you encounter any problems please email ulfek@ifm.liu.se and
include the compiler output and a description of your system.
