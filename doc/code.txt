Description of the various directories and files:

doc/*: Documentation
pov/*: Povray 3.5 model files. Should make by itself, 
       but doesn't just yet.
data/*: Datafiles for the game. At the moment all of these
	come from the povray models in pov/.
src/sprite/*: A basic sprite library used by the game
src/support/*: Freestanding (or almost..) utility functions
src/sprite_types/*: Definition of the different sprite types.
		    These are picked up automagically by the 
		    main Makefile.
src/*: The game itself. These are the ugliest parts of the code.  

The main Makefile is src/Makefile.
