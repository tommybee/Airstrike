Collision detection does not work very
well when an object is completely inside another.
The collision is detected, but there is no transfer
of momentum etc. This is due to the lack of a suitable
normal.

The collision routines makes object resting on the
ground a bit shaky.

The planes reappear directly when killed..

There seem to be an off-by-one error in the dirty
rect handling, as seen when the score counter leaves
a vertical line of pixels behind.

Sound and pause mode interact badly.

bug in console where one char gets lost if the line wraps.


----------(fixed)-------------------

The console mode is kind of buggy. For example the game time passes
very slowly, even though the game is paused.
