objects:
	birds (that get sucked into engines)
	more types of biplanes
	zepplin airships [worked on]
	a dragon
	AA gun on the the ground [worked on]
	surface-to-air missile launcher
	ufo's [mostly done]

sounds:
	Audio taunts, specially Wagner that can be played 'Apocalypse 
	Now' style. Best on a large level.

	Candid audience sound: applause/laughter/boo sounds.
	(is this idea from Worms?)

game styles:
	Single screen dogfight (this is the one we have right now)

	Larger level, RTS style: Collect resources, upgrade planes
	etc. This can be team multiplayer. A bit like 'Gravity Force',
	and other cave-flying games.

	Larger level, shoot-em-up style. Like R-Type, or 'Blood money'
	on the Amiga. Try to survivle though the whole level. This
	could be one or two players.

  'theme' levels:
	Biplane - Time Warp:
	An 'around the world' level, where you fly over a lot of famous
	places and try to {protect|destroy|fly past} famous monuments, and
	encounter 'native' resistance (kamikaze pilots/F16 fighters/
	Concorde planes/Scud missiles etc). This could also feature
	fly-bys of famous historical events.

	Nuclear War level, with real big nukes (apparently dropped from
	biplanes).

	A space level with asteroids-like asteriods and Space Invader
	type enemies.

	A deathstar level where you have to bomb the reactor and fight
	tie fighters.

	An 'Independence Day' type level where you have to fly up towards
	the center of the really big ufo and (again) shoot the reactor
	to kill the ufo. (You know, from that one scene in the movie..)

	A fantasy-style level with dragons, castles, wizards etc.
