Some notes about the physics model:
Large letters are used for vectors.

Basic (with no intention of being 'realistic'):
All aerodynamical objects are shaped as ellipsoids,
in the way they interact with the air.

                  
                  ^ N_n (up)
                  |  
      ___        ____ 
       | A_t    /    \ ---> N_t ('forward' direction)
      _|_       \____/
       
                |----|
                  A_n 

In the case of A_n = A_t we get:

F_air = - A_n*v^2*(V/|V|), where v is velocity relative to the wind.

Air is deflected from the body under the angle alpha, where
  
    |V|cos(alpha) = (N_n . V)    

In a given instant the momentum of the air hitting the object
is

P_air ~ V*(|V.N_t|A_t + |V.N_n|A_n)

Assuming A_t < A_n, a part, D, of the momentum is
deflected against the normal N_n. 

D ~ (V.N_n)*(A_t - A_n) (or maybe A_n/A_t ?)

After the air has interacted with the object the momentum 
of the air is

P_after = P_air*(1 - x) - N_n*y, where the object has
gained x*P_air + N_n*y in momentum.

Forces acting on a body described by {R,angle,V,omega}
engine pull Fe(angle)
air resistance Fair(V,angle,wind)
lifting force Flift(Fair,angle)

Torques:
Dampening Mdamp(omega)
Air res. minimization Mair(Fair,angle)

More specifically:
Fe = C_engine*N_angle

Fair = A[2]V_eff, where A[2] is a 2x2 matrix, dependent on
N_angle*V_eff and the rudders. V_eff = V - Wind
