This directory contains the definitions for each sprite type.
Guidelines:
Each type should fit completely in a single source file. Use
struct mysprite{ sprite_t base; .. } for extending the sprite types.

If your sprite holds a pointer to another sprite it _must_ reference it
using sprite_aquire(), and check if is alive before working on it by
using the sprite_isvalid() function.
