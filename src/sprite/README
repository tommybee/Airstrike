	A small sprite library which performs the 
	following tasks:
	
	1) Load animations from files
	2) Draw animations to screen
	3) Keeps dirty rectangles list
	4) Draws background
	5) Finds collisions
	6) moves sprites and updates animations
	7) Keeps a constant framerate

	The idea is that this library performs
	all pixel-related operations.
