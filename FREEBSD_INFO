Instructions to build Airstrike on Freebsd 4.x or 5.x 

1. Install SDL 1.2 
   
   cd /usr/ports/devel/sdl12/
   make install clean
   
2. Make sure you have the configuration file '/usr/local/bin/sdl-config'
   If it doesn't exist you must make a symbolic link,
   
   ln -s /usr/local/bin/sdl11-config /usr/local/bin/sdl-config
   
3. Install SDL Image

   cd /usr/ports/graphics/sdl_image
   make install clean

4. Edit the Makefile of airstrike 'src/Makefile'

   Change line 4 
   'CFLAGS += -DLINUX' to
   '# CFLAGS += -DLINUX'
   
5. Run 'gmake' or 'gmake airstrike-sound'
